			<h2 style={{fontSize:"11px", color:"#658E9C"}}>Junior Full Stack Web Developer with the goal to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Earned a certificate in full stack development from Michigan State University. Maintained a grade average of 90% throughout the entire cohort. Innovative problem solver who enjoys developing apps while also focusing on making sure the app has a mobile-first design and development. Every project I’m involved in my goal is to make sure that the user has a good experience while interacting with my app. In a recent project my team and I used flex box to make sure that our app would be easy to use on any device they may be on. The project we were working on had a team of four to develop a web app to help the user come up with a recipe for dinner using ingredients they already had in their fridge. The app also would generate a random cocktail if the user was in the mood for a drink but didn’t know what they wanted. I’m very excited to use my new skills in a fast-paced environment with a quality-driven and hard working team to build a better experience on the web for all users</h2>
