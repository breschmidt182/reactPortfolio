			<h1 className="title is-1">About Me</h1>
			
			<h2>As an aspiring Junior Full Stack Web Developer, my passion lies in creating web experiences that not only function flawlessly but also resonate intuitively with users. Holding a commendable certificate in full stack development from Michigan State University, I've adeptly mastered an array of technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, and React, all while embracing the art of responsive web design. <br></br> <br></br>

				My approach to problem-solving is characterized by a blend of innovation and practicality, where I relish untangling complex challenges to unveil elegant solutions. What truly sets my heart racing is the opportunity to develop applications that not only work seamlessly but also prioritize a mobile-first design ethos. My guiding principle revolves around ensuring that every user's journey through an application is marked by a remarkable and engaging experience. <br></br> <br></br>

				In a recent team project, we set out to conquer the intricacies of cross-device functionality by harnessing the power of flexbox. This collaborative effort birthed a web application designed to assist users in crafting dinner recipes using ingredients readily available in their fridges â€“ a true embodiment of creativity meeting utility. <br></br> <br></br>

				Fuelled by excitement and a genuine desire to excel, I am now on the lookout for an energetic, quality-driven team that mirrors my enthusiasm. The prospect of immersing myself in a fast-paced environment, where my skills can seamlessly merge with a collective dedication to excellence, truly excites me. Together, we can not only elevate web experiences but also construct digital journeys that resonate with users on an exceptional level.
